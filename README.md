# SearchEngine
A large-scale search engine for a text-based dataset using positional inverted indexing and ranked retrievals.

Key features :

- Ask the user for the name of the directory to index, and then load all the documents in that directory and construct the positional inverted index with their contents.
- Process the user's Boolean search queries on the index constructed.
- Process the user's ranked retrieval queries on the disk-based inverted index constructed.
